        <h2>What does this mean?</h2>
        <p>
          “It’s chill” is a vibe and a mindset. It’s that moment where you remind yourself to stay grounded, calm, and
          positive. Saying it doesn’t mean you don’t care — it means you’re choosing calm over chaos. It’s a tiny reset
          button you can use anytime your life starts getting loud.

        <h2>Is everything always really chill?</h2>
        <p>
          Let’s be real. No, life is not always chill. Life can be messy, emotional, and unbelievably stressful. But you
          can still stay chill in the middle of all that. This movement is not about pretending everything is sunshine;
          it’s about learning to breathe, ground yourself, and not let one moment take over your whole mood. It’s your
          reminder that even when things aren’t chill, you can be.

        <h2>Does saying “it’s chill” mean I shouldn’t express my emotions?</h2>
        <p>
          Not at all. “It’s chill” is not a way to shut down your feelings — it’s a way to give yourself a second to
          actually understand them. Expression is healthy, you can still be sad, annoyed, stressed, or overwhelmed. The
          phrase just helps you stay grounded enough to process what you’re feeling instead of letting it control you.
          Being chill doesn’t mean being numb; it means handling your emotions with clarity instead of chaos.

        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <p>
          Start saying it’s chill more often! Especially in the stressful times in your life. That small moment
          interrupts the spiral and helps your brain shift out of panic mode. From there, you breathe, re-center, and
          then deal with whatever’s in front of you with more calm and clarity. The more you use it, the more automatic
          it becomes. It turns into two simple words you can rely on anytime life throws you something unexpected.
